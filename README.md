This site is just a beginner site, where new contributors are encouraged and asked to contribute to Drupal.

How community works?

The Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome. 

First thing you need to do before contribution is joining the community - 

Essential IRC Channels to Join

    #drupal is a lounge of sorts. Here, we talk about patches we need reviewed, quick how-to questions, and what we've been doing with Drupal lately, among other things. If it's Drupal-related, and isn't in-depth enough to take over the channel with lots of text, and doesn't need a quiet venue, it is fair game in #drupal.
    #drupal-contribute is the place to go if you want to help with core and contrib coding work, promotion, advocacy, infrastructure, and general Drupal community tasks. The rule of thumb here: if it ends up on the drupal.org infrastructure, and you are working on it or want to work on it, then this is the place to talk about it.
    #drupal-support is for long or deep support discussions. While quick questions are okay in #drupal, some discussions are just too long for that channel, or need a quieter venue -- that's when they go in #drupal-support.
